# RESPONSES!
2/8/21: I hope to learn how to actually implement machine learning algorithms and things like neural networks, instead of just knowing a brief concept of what they are. Also very excited to learn how to apply machine learning to different things!

2/9/21: 
    1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
        Supervised machine learning is when the program is trained on a predefined set of training examples, allowing it to reach an accurate conclusion with any new data               given. Unsupervised machine learning is when the program needs
   to find patterns and relationships on a given dataset.
    2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
        Scikit-Learn doesn't have the power to visualize data without the data analysis libraries because it is responsible for data modeling, but not the loading, handling,           manipulating, and visualising of data which is what the other libraries are responsible for.
