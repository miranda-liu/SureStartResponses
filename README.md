2/8/21: I hope to learn how to actually implement machine learning algorithms and things like neural networks, instead of just knowing a brief concept of what they are. Also very excited to learn how to apply machine learning to different things!

    1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
        Supervised machine learning is when the program is trained on a predefined set of training examples, allowing it to reach an accurate conclusion with any new data given. Unsupervised machine learning is when the program needs
   to find patterns and relationships on a given dataset.
    2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
        Scikit-Learn doesn't have the power to visualize data without the data analysis libraries because it is responsible for data modeling, but not the loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data which is what the other libraries are responsible for.

2/10/21: 
    1. What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
         Tensors are the mathematical representation of a physical thing that can be described through magnitude and many directions. In machine learning, tensors can represent multi-dimensional data.
    2. What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow
       programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
          When running the computations in the tutorial, I noticed that **COME BACK TO FINISH

    -Problem: predict potential wildfire locations across the U.S. based on precipitation, air temperatures, land surface temperatures, and heat wave dates
    -Datasets: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D104;jsessionid=2E289443248F94E5F580EC2080EB, https://wonder.cdc.gov/nasa-nldas.html, https://wonder.cdc.gov/nasa-lst.html, https://wonder.cdc.gov/nasa-precipitation.html
    -Approach/algorithm: Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) because I saw that they can retain info over time, which means that it is able to recall older info to make better predictions.
